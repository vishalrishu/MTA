**Molecular Trajectory Analysis**

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for studying the physical
movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact
for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic evolution of the system. In
the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined
by numerically solving Newton’s equations of motion for a system of interacting
particles, where forces between the particles and their potential energies are often
calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics force fields. The
method was originally developed within the field of theoretical physics in the late
1950s but is applied today mostly in chemical physics, materials science and the
modelling of biomolecules.
